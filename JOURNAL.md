1. I signed up to miro.com and drew the wire frame for the homepage
2. I pushed it to the github dirrectory
3. I tried to recreate the rotating Earth model with THREE.js (I do not know anything about THREE.js, just saw people at codepen use it)
4. Realized that I can do it with pure CSS and watched a video on how to do it
5. Managed to make the rotating Earth part

1. I wrote a summary on all of the features and started doing further research on it like finding API's to get data from and other information.
2. I also started a course on Udemy on making webpages.
3. I decided to focus on this project at night time and to focus on the Udemy course at day time.

1. I continued on with the summary of all the features
2. I also highlighted the features that I believe would make customers want to visit the page over and over again.
3. I saw fit to remove the economic data feature as well because all of the API's I searched has data from 2 years ago.
4. I am thinking of doing a redesign to the home page as well.
5. Since it is the main page (navigational page) of the website I want it to look as good as possible.
6. I added a time zone converter feature as well ,but I was doubtful to wheather it should be added or not
7. Right now I think that I should replace it with a feature that allows for time conversion and a little blog post under it which provides people a history of time recording devices.
8. I also think that I should provide proper and attractive names to each feature because it will help with SEO.

1. I redesigned the home page and I now think that the home page looks very much better
2. Before all the features were clamped up in one spot but now everything is more organized
3. I also added more features into the summary section
4. Iam also not doubtfull towards the addition of the time zone converter any more
