1. I signed up to miro.com and drew the wire frame for the homepage
2. I pushed it to the github dirrectory
3. I tried to recreate the rotating Earth model with THREE.js (I do not know anything about THREE.js, just saw people at codepen use it)
4. Realized that I can do it with pure CSS and watched a video on how to do it
5. Managed to make the rotating Earth part

1. I wrote a summary on all of the features and started doing further research on it like finding API's to get data from and other information.
2. I also started a course on Udemy on making webpages.
3. I decided to focus on this project at night time and to focus on the Udemy course at day time.

1. I continued on with the summary of all the features
2. I also highlighted the features that I believe would make customers want to visit the page over and over again.
3. I saw fit to remove the economic data feature as well because all of the API's I searched has data from 2 years ago.
4. I am thinking of doing a redesign to the home page as well.
5. Since it is the main page (navigational page) of the website I want it to look as good as possible.
6. I added a time zone converter feature as well ,but I was doubtful to wheather it should be added or not
7. Right now I think that I should replace it with a feature that allows for time conversion and a little blog post under it which provides people a history of time recording devices.
8. I also think that I should provide proper and attractive names to each feature because it will help with SEO.

1. I redesigned the home page and I now think that the home page looks very much better
2. Before all the features were clamped up in one spot but now everything is more organized
3. I also added more features into the summary section
4. Iam also not doubtfull towards the addition of the time zone converter any more

1. I redesigned the home page grid layout to make it more attractive
2. I added a HomePage Text.md file to write the text that is going to be in the home page
3. I worked on finding a good background and theme but I couldn't find any
4. I am wondering if I should just make all the wire frames and then decide the theme
5. I also asked for advice from others on the order in which I should do this
6. Progress on this site has been slow because I have been putting a lot of attention to the Udemy course from the morning to atleast 7PM
7. And the rest of the time is being spent on the website
8. Iam thinking of flipping that around now and spending the mornings on this site and the nights on Udemy course
9. I will prepare a scheduel for my self to manage time once I get up
10. If I do 2 sections a day I predict it would take me 21 days to get through the whole course

1. I worked on defining the functionalities very well this time instead of focussing a lot on the design as the first part.
2. And it helped because it got right down to the details of what the website really needs to look like and in what ways users want to use the website and how I should desing it to meet the users use cases.
