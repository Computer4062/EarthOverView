1. I signed up to miro.com and drew the wire frame for the homepage
2. I pushed it to the github dirrectory
3. I tried to recreate the rotating Earth model with THREE.js (I do not know anything about THREE.js, just saw people at codepen use it)
4. Realized that I can do it with pure CSS and watched a video on how to do it
5. Managed to make the rotating Earth part

1. I wrote a summary on all of the features and started doing further research on it like finding API's to get data from and other information.
2. I also started a course on Udemy on making webpages.
3. I decided to focus on this project at night time and to focus on the Udemy course at day time.
